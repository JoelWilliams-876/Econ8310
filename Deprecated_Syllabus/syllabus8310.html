OR Instructor Approval<br />
We will be creating our own forecasts, and my examples will use Python. You are welcome to use any other programming language you prefer (such as R), but <strong>I will not provide support for other software or languages</strong>.</p>
<p>.25in</p></li>
<li><p>The course will cover forecasting tools and applications applied to business settings. We will cover traditional Econometric forecasting methods in the first half of the class. In the second half of the course, we will focus on models in predictive analytics and machine learning, since these models are quickly becoming critical tools for forecasters in many settings. The course will include lecture and lab time, and labs will be focused on teaching students how to implement the models discussed in lectures.</p></li>

<li><p>UNO’s requirements for Academic Integrity and Behavior All students are required to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity and behavior and must satisfy the <strong><a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php">UNO Academic Integrity Policy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/code-of-conduct.php">Student Code of Conduct</a></strong>. It is the student’s responsibility to read, understand and abide by these policies. If I find that you have plagiarized, been dishonest in completing your assignments, or cheated an an exam or assignment, then I reserve the right to award you no points on the entire exam, project, or assignment and to report the behavior to the university. If this behavior is repeated, I reserve the right to award a failing grade, independent of your score on other assignments. Academic integrity is essential to education, and I take it very seriously.</p>
