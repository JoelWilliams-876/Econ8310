<p><strong>Midterm Team Exam</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>This midterm exam is designed to give you and your teammates a chance to create a solution to a real-world problem using the tools from this class. The intent of the examination is to allow you to demonstrate your ability to choose an appropriate solution from your forecasting toolkit, and present your solution to the rest of the class. The data and the problem will be provided on the first day of the Exam by the instructor.</p>
<p><strong>What to Prepare</strong><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Your team is expected to prepare the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An executive summary of the problem and your <em>prototyped</em> solution</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Should be clear and concise</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to be readable by non-specialists</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A 10-12 minute presentation of your solution (each team will present to the class!). We will allow up to 3 minutes of questions from the class after your presentation is completed.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>ALL team members should be part of the presentation</p></li>
<li><p>State findings first, then detail the why and the how</p></li>
<li><p>May use whatever presentation technology you want</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Your code, as well as the data file that you used (we share both in order to enable replication, since this is a critical component of analysis)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Please comment all code, to make it clear to new readers</p></li>
<li><p>I should be able to run the code without errors on my computer</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the data <strong>as you formatted it to work with your code</strong></p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note on Grading</strong><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Even though this is a group project, I reserve the right to grade each individual, and will not hesitate to award a higher grade to team members who contribute more to the project than to those team members who choose not to contribute to the progress of their team.</p>
